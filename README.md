## Automotive Data Analysis Dashboards
This portfolio entry showcases two distinct dashboards designed to analyze automotive data, providing valuable insights into vehicle characteristics, engine performance, and pricing trends. These dashboards demonstrate proficiency in data visualization, analytical thinking, and the ability to extract actionable intelligence from complex datasets.

## Dashboard 1: Car Body and Engine Analysis 
This dashboard focuses on understanding the relationships between various car body and engine specifications and their performance metrics. It provides a detailed breakdown of how different engine types, cylinder numbers, and engine placements correlate with compression ratio, fuel efficiency (highway and city MPG), and horsepower.

## Key Features & Insights:

Total Cars Count: A prominent display of the total number of cars in the dataset (205), providing context for the analysis.

Min of Compression Ratio by Engine Type: This chart highlights the minimum compression ratio for different engine types (e.g., DOHCV, Rotor, OHC). This insight is crucial for understanding engine design and performance characteristics.

Min of Stroke by Fuel Type: Visualizes the minimum engine stroke based on fuel type (diesel vs. gas), which can indicate differences in engine architecture and efficiency.

Average of Highway MPG by Engine Location: Compares the average highway fuel efficiency of cars with front vs. rear engine locations, offering insights into design choices and their impact on performance.

Min of Horsepower by Cylinder Number: Shows the minimum horsepower associated with different cylinder numbers (e.g., twelve, eight, five, six), providing a baseline understanding of power output across engine configurations.

Min of Price by Cylinder Number: While primarily an engine analysis dashboard, this chart touches upon how cylinder number might correlate with the minimum price of a vehicle.

Count of Car ID by Aspiration: Distinguishes between naturally aspirated (std) and turbocharged (turbo) cars by count, indicating the prevalence of each aspiration type in the dataset.

Average of City MPG by Engine Location: Similar to highway MPG, this chart analyzes city fuel efficiency based on engine location, providing a comprehensive view of urban driving performance.

Average of Horsepower by Engine Type: Displays the average horsepower for different engine types, offering a direct comparison of power output across various engine designs.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Comparative Analysis: Ability to compare and contrast various automotive attributes.

Performance Metrics Visualization: Effective display of critical engine and vehicle performance indicators.

Categorical Data Analysis: Breaking down quantitative metrics by discrete categories like engine type, fuel type, and engine location.

## Dashboard 2: Price Impact Analysis
This dashboard delves into the factors influencing car prices, providing a granular view of how different car body types, door numbers, fuel types, engine characteristics, and fuel systems impact the sum of prices. This analysis is vital for understanding market value drivers and pricing strategies.

## Key Features & Insights:

Total Cars Count: Consistent with the first dashboard, showing the total number of cars analyzed.

Sum of Price by Car Body: Reveals which car body types (e.g., sedan, hatchback, wagon) command the highest cumulative prices in the dataset, indicating market demand or premium positioning.

Sum of Price by Door Number: Compares the total price sum for two-door vs. four-door vehicles, offering insights into consumer preferences and associated pricing.

Sum of Price by Fuel Type: Clearly differentiates the total price sum between diesel and gas cars, highlighting potential market value differences.

Sum of Price by Cylinder Number: Shows the cumulative price impact of different cylinder numbers, indicating that higher cylinder counts generally correspond to higher overall prices.

Sum of Price by Engine Type: Analyzes the total price sum across various engine types, identifying which engine technologies are associated with higher cumulative values.

Sum of Price by Engine Location: Examines how engine placement (front vs. rear) influences the total sum of prices, suggesting whether one configuration is more prevalent or premium.

Sum of Price by Aspiration: Compares the total price sum between standard (naturally aspirated) and turbocharged vehicles, often revealing that turbocharged cars command a higher cumulative market value.

Sum of Price by Fuel System: Breaks down the total price sum by different fuel system types (e.g., MPFI, 2BBL, IDI), providing detailed insights into the pricing implications of various fuel delivery mechanisms.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Factor-Based Pricing Analysis: Identifying and visualizing the impact of various vehicle attributes on price.

Aggregation and Summarization: Using sum aggregations to understand the total monetary value associated with different categories.

Market Trend Identification: Ability to infer market preferences and value propositions based on pricing data.

## Overall Project Impact:

These dashboards collectively demonstrate strong capabilities in:

Data Cleaning and Preparation (Implied): The creation of such detailed analyses requires robust data handling.

Advanced Data Visualization: Utilizing a variety of charts to effectively convey complex automotive data.

Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard Creation: Designing intuitive and insightful dashboards for analytical purposes.

Automotive Domain Knowledge (Implied): Understanding the relevance of metrics like compression ratio, engine stroke, MPG, and their impact on vehicle performance and pricing.

Actionable Insights Generation: Transforming raw data into meaningful information that can inform decisions related to vehicle design, marketing, sales, and pricing strategies.

This project underscores my ability to leverage data to uncover critical insights within the automotive industry, providing a foundation for strategic business decisions.
